Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course highlights the interplay between cellular and molecular storage mechanisms and the cognitive neuroscience of memory, with an emphasis on human and animal models of hippocampal mechanisms and function. Class sessions include lectures and discussion of papers.

Textbook
--------

Gluck, Mark, Eduardo Mercado, and Catherine Myers. _Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior_. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007. ISBN: 9780716786542.

Class Presentations
-------------------

In each class, two assigned articles will be presented by students, followed by class discussion. Before each class each student is to prepare a synopsis of the two articles that will be presented by students. This exercise is intended to make you sufficiently familiar with the articles to permit an intelligent discussion after each presentation.
